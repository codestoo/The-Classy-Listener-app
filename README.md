# Overview

I love music! I love various styles, especially Classical, Contemporary Christian, Movie Scores and Jazz. I use spotify, but I have a difficult time finding what I'm looking for. It's like when you feel like something specific, but you don't know what. I want to make an app to solve that problem with user input.

Using Notion to organize my tasks for my React app, I have set up the bootstrap navbar, React router for the pages and am working on the bootstrap carousel for the home page. Next, I will work on the spotify API.


App in progress...wish me luck!
